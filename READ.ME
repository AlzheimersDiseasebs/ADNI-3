The ADNI-3 Data Set is included.

The images in the dataset with the .DCM extension can be resized and converted to PNG by adjusting them to the size of the model that needs to be run.

The classification labels in the CSV file then need to be matched to the images.

After the dataset was matched with the CSV file, the models were run using 10-fold cross validation. And slice selection was done. Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was used for slice selection. And 5 images were selected with this method. 

On the selected images, both the ready-made models were tested and the newly developed models were run. If desired, new models can be tested and run on the dataset.
